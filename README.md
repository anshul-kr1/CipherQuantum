# CipherQuantum

Quantum encryption has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity by providing an unbreakable encryption method based on fundamental laws of physics.

## Why End-to-End encryption (which most applications use) will fail in the next coming decades -

When it comes to breaking encryption, classical computers rely on algorithms that involve complex mathematical computations, such as factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem. These algorithms, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, form the basis of many encryption schemes used in end-to-end encryption. Currently, there are no known efficient classical algorithms that can break these encryption schemes.

On the other hand, quantum computers have the potential to break certain types of encryption algorithms more efficiently. For example, Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm, can efficiently factor large numbers, which would render RSA encryption vulnerable. Similarly, Grover's algorithm can speed up brute-force searches, impacting symmetric encryption algorithms like AES

## What is CypherQuantum?

It is a Quantum Encryption Network that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to create an ultra-secure communication channel. Quantum encryption relies on the phenomenon of entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD) to ensure that messages exchanged between parties cannot be intercepted or tampered with.

We use the BB84 protocol to generated the quantum encrypted keys, a simulation of a Quantum Computer is also available which shows the key generation.

## Can our encryption be broken even by Quantum Computers?

In a quantum encryption network, the encryption keys are generated and distributed using quantum states, such as photons, that are encoded with the information. Any attempt to eavesdrop or intercept the quantum states would disturb them, leading to detectable changes and making it impossible for an attacker to gain access to the encryption keys without being detected.
